## Introduction

This report summarizes the progress made in detecting suspicious objects within the provided videos as part of the assignment from Sadiya Banu. The objective is to analyze the videos for significant movements and events that may indicate suspicious activities.

## Progress Made

We have successfully implemented a system to analyze the videos and save those containing significant movements and interesting events. The key steps in this process included:

1. **Video Processing**: We utilized OpenCV to read and process the video files. Each frame was extracted for analysis.

2. **Movement Detection**: Significant movements were detected using background subtraction techniques and object tracking methods. This allowed us to identify frames where notable activity occurred.

3. **Data Storage**: The frames with significant movements were saved for further analysis. This step ensures that we have a focused dataset to work with when applying our models.

## Next Steps

With the videos containing significant movements saved, we can now proceed with analyzing this data using an activity recognition model. As I am new to working with activity recognition models, I will need additional time to research and implement this approach effectively.

Once the model is applied, we will be able to generate alerts for any suspicious activities detected. This will enhance the security and monitoring capabilities of the system.

## Conclusion

The initial phase of the project has been successfully completed, laying the groundwork for the next steps in implementing an activity recognition model. Continued research and development will be essential for effectively detecting suspicious objects and activities in the videos.
